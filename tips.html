      <h2>Top 5 Travel Tips</h2>
      <section id="tips-list">
        <article class="tip">
          <h3>1. Get an Oyster Card or Use Contactless</h3>
          <p>Cash payments for transit are costly and inconvenient. For the
            cheapest tickets on the Tube, buses, and the majority of rail
            services, use a contactless card or device or purchase a Visitor
            Oyster card. It's the most economical mode of transportation.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Stand on the Right</h3>
          <p>Always stand on the right side of escalators on the London
            Underground so that passengers in a hurry can ascend on the left.
            Londoners take this unspoken rule very seriously!
          </p>
          <h3>3. Explore Beyond Zone 1</h3>
          <p>There is a lot more to see in the outer zones of London, even if
            central London (Zone 1) includes several well-known attractions. To
            get a different view of the city, go to places like Richmond,
            Hampstead Heath, or Greenwich.
          </p>
          <h3>4. Check for Free Museums</h3>
          <p>The Tate Modern, the National Gallery, and the British Museum are
            just a few of London's top museums and galleries that provide free
            admission to their permanent collections. Tickets for special
            exhibitions are often paid for.
          </p>
          <h3>5. Tipping is Not Always Necessary</h3>
          <p>A 12.5% service charge is frequently automatically added to the bill
            at restaurants. Tipping service is not standard. It's courteous to
            round up the fee for cabs.
